# CSC375

Projects for the parallel computing course at SUNY Oswego (3 Projects)

## Project 1

Write a program that can optimize unit organization within a space (objects are weighted and higher weighted objects should be nearer to each other)

## Project 2

Write your own version of some data structure in parallel (I chose a hash table)

## Project 3

Choose a game (from a limited selection) and write a program that can determine the next best move in any given situation (I chose minesweeper)
